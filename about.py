Our project is one of accessibility and safety. HydrOracle utilizes water level data along the Mississippi River from the 
United States Geological Survey (USGS), and translates it into graphs which can be easily accessed, interpreted, and utilized 
by everyone. Not only do these graphs provide insight into past trends in water level data, but they also hold predictive capabilities, 
which provide insight into trends that the future may bring, including the potential for increased flooding. 
With Hydroracle, anyone from a concerned citizen to a government policymaker can better understand what the future may bring 
their community, and act accordingly. With this head start, the lives and wellbeing of countless individuals living along the 
Mississippi River may be protected. With HydrOracle, data becomes actionable insights.
